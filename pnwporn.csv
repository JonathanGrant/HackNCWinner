About me:   I am looking for a young woman to help me by acting in my adult film. I have always dreamed of getting into this industry. I have been actively trying for the past 7 years now. It is really hard getting your foot in the door. Last year I finally saved up enough to make my first film and I did so with an established starlett in the industry. I'm now looking to do so with another starlett. I have a huge passion for this work. Meting new people is the best part of this entire experience. But it is costing a lot for me to keep trying to reach my dream of being a film director. I want this next film to be my last and let it help me reach my goals of directing. Ive saved up the past year to fiber the entire project and am now ready to select the last part of the cast. This is a 3 girl/1guy film. I only need to find 1 more female to select. I am young 25 athletic educated white and work full time as a hotel manager. I am married and have a little one on the way. I am looking for this to be my way of reaching my dreams and I am so excited to complete my journey.       My desired actress:   I really want the 3rd girl to be young thin and have a great face. I prefer petite of any race. But I am open to average build. Please with nothing but respect do not apply if on the heavier side. I am however very open to working with anyone who has an extemely beautiful face. I need a girl who is very reliable meaning they are very easy to get a hold of. They have to be professional and easy to communicate with. I do not wish to work with anyone who escorts or abuses drugs please. To sum it up looking for thin or average set women who are highly open minded not flaky respectful passionate like me with a lot of energy.       *I only pay in cash and I do so before any work is competed. This film will be kept private and I can provide the actress with a copy for their portfolio if needed.      * I have shared a lot about myself and I plese ask that you provide clear face photos body photos an acting name contact number so I can reach you quickly and tell me why you decided to get into the industry. I want to find someone with my sane passion    ,10,0.0044964028777,1

We are looking for a couple of models (although most photos would be of just one model at a time) to pose unclothed in the basic Yoga poses and more if you know additional poses. This is a two-fold project. One to photograph the beauty of the unclothed human form combined with the beauty of yoga. Secondly to showcase at some point in the future black and white yoga photographs in a book. So naturally you need to have some knowledge of Yoga and also be comfortable posing without clothing. Care will be taken to use proper angles that show the pose and model in the best possible way. The photographer has been working with the figure for many years. Couples are encouraged to respond but also individuals. If you have any kind of picture of yourself please send it with your reply. Thank you!    ,0,0.0,0

I don't care if you are an auto macanic or just really good with cars. It's a 97 Chrysler cirrus. I just need someone to come to my apartment and get it running again. It's been sitting for months. I live in the Thurston area. It doesn't make any sounds when I turn the key. A guy told me it might be the alternator. I don't want to take it to a shop because I don't have much money now and most places try to over charge women. I was told that it can probably be diagnosed in only a few minutes and is likely a pretty easy fix. I just know nothing about cars. Right now I can only put $80 into fixing it. If you look at it and the problem is something that $80(parts and labor) won't fix I will still give you $10 for coming out and taking a look.    ,0,0.0,0

We are very good at planning our meals so this would literally be to take the groceries we get (at the moment normally on Sunday) and chop them accordingly so that as we proceed through the week we save the time of prep work (and associated dishes.)      We customarily make three meals per week (one that will last two nights each time).      I have no idea how much someone would charge for this but I would want to pay fairly if we were in fact to do this. I am thinking a range of $30 - $50 per week but I actually need to clear this line item with my husband. :) At the moment I'm trying to think strategically on how we can better optimize our time and the hubs absolutely loves healthy home-cooked meals but hates the associated time with prep and cleanup.

I currently use this RV/mobile home for temporary full-time occupancy so I am eager to nip the problem in the bud.      I am currently abating the mold. However I am not comfortable performing weatherization minor roof repairs etc. that are necessary to fortify my home from rain and to reduce condensation. Therefore I am looking for a skilled person (mobile home/RV experience preferred) to provide assessment repairs and/or consultation on the issues that I'm having.       I am seeking more information about how to proceed including an initial non-binding quotation based on the information that I will provide below. If you are interested in this work please email me a few sentences about yourself your CCB# (if applicable) an initial assessment of what my needs are and a quick dollar estimate for each of the three areas below.       ASSESSMENT   Please see the attached pictures of the issues that I'm having with the roof. I have purchased rubber coating spray to cover the cracks and spaces on the roof but there haven't been enough dry days over the past 2 weeks for me to do the work myself. I wish to have the full project quoted after an on-site visit. Please provide your initial assessment of my needs as well as the cost of an on-site assessment (if applicable).      REPAIRS   Consistent with the initial assessment please provide an initial quotation/range on what repairs might cost with the understanding that a firmer quotation will happen after on-site assessment. In addition to the roof there are major moisture/rain infiltration issues around the driver door which have developed into mold. The third issue is the seals around the windows and I'm unable to tell if the pooling of water in the sills is from condensation or infiltration.       CONSULTATION   Regardless of whether repairs are necessary I am very interested in learning more about how to moisture-""proof"" my home. At the very least I am looking for someone who can impart some knowledge about what I can do on my own to prevent these issues or even what they have learned from having/living in their own RV/mobile home.

The easiest $50 you'll ever earn,salem,http://salem.craigslist.org/lbg/5850896871.html,2016-10-28T13:42:24-0700,44.949,-123.004,labor,50,Could you use an extra $50? Together we can get it for you easy      $50 is really just the icing on the cake. If you have a spare 3-4 hours a week you can earn $65/week donating plasma at Talecris Plasma Resources on Belmont in Salem. That breaks down into a first donation of the week earning of $25 and a second donation of the week earning of $40. Plus the first 5 visits pay more than that! On your first donation you'll receive $50 $50 on your 2nd visit $30 on your 3rd visit $40 on your 4th visit and $30 on your 5th visit. Each visit takes 1.5-2 hours depending on how busy they are when you check in. Get paid via their prepaid visa card immediately once you finish donating.            Now back to the $50 - If you've never donated plasma at Talecris before you can use me as your reference when you first go sign up to donate. After you've donated twice as part of their buddy bonus referral program they will apply a $100 bonus to my prepaid card once I donate again. I donate Tuesdays and Saturdays every week. Once I get the bonus we could arrange to meet either at Talecris or in West Salem where I live or another place close by and I would give you your 50/50 share - $50.            It's very easy to donate and a quick way to earn a little extra because I know we both could use a little extra cash to help the budget. The $100 bonus amount is an October only promotion they are having so don't procrastinate contact me now and head to Talecris!            Please contact me if you have any questions. The sooner you sign up and donate twice the sooner we can get this deal done. My cell is     show contact info   if you have any questions    ,0,0.0,0

I didn't get any replies last time but realized they may go to spam so I'm putting the ad up again.       Hello!      I need some advice on how to proceed with my roofer. I hired this roofer to reroof my home. He ended up tearing it off and then left the roof off on my home for two days and we had some very bad rain. It ended up leaking through to the interior of my home and there is water damage in numerous places in my ceiling plus a wet carpet. There is also a new leak in my laundry room that wasn't there before.       When confronted the roofer (Landon Paul roofing) told me that he is sorry but it isn't his fault and that I should expect leaks when I get a new roof as he cant control the weather. He said he tarped it (found out he tarped it Thursday morning after tearing off on a tue) and that should have kept the rain out. He denies there's any damage and he did ""quality"" work.       Is there anything I can do?  Do I have to pay him the rest of his money? I'm already going to have to hire someone to repair the interior from leaks plus a carpet cleaner to clean the carpet. Plus someone to redo his shoddy job. He is insured and bonded but I can't get through to anyone to make a claim at his insurance company.       Need someone with references and a lot of experience to diagnose this problem and fix the roof so there are no leaks.       Thank you!    ",0,0.0,0

What we need your account for   is to post advertisements for our customers. The products or services   promoted could range from a free trial pass to sports   products that they are promoting.      What I would be doing with your advertising account is to create a business page manage it and   build a following to it before posting the marketing campaigns I've created for my customers      The ads actually show up as sponsored content from the page that I create so your name is never associated with the ads and no one on your friends list will even know there are ads coming from your advertising account         This opportunity actually takes about 10 minutes of your time every couple of days and pays $150/month. Payments are made through paypal every 30 days.      Do you have any questions?      Please provide a number that we can reach you at!      Thanks      Leon   ,0,0.0,0

I have been doing pretty much all landscape so far but I want to transition into more portrait work. I have this idea of a shoot in a cool spot on one of the lakes in Anacortes that has some awesome trees growing around and in the water that I've already done some location scouting on.      I want this shoot to have a very peaceful ""one with nature"" kind of feel. Involving the water and the trees coming up out of the water. I'm happy to incorporate your ideas into this shoot if there's anything you want to try as well. This is a fully clothed non nude shoot and I will treat you with complete professionalism.       I'm just looking for a model preferably a newer one looking to expand his or her portfolio that wants to have a fun shoot around this lake and see what kind of images we can create. So this is a trade shoot (non paid though I will happily buy lunch afterwards :)) where I will take the pictures and put them on a CD and give all the copies over to you to use however you'd like. I will also be happy to include some of the images I edit as well for your portfolio.      The pictures I have attached are some of the shots I have taken recently mostly landscape. They dont very good on here but if i send them to you by email they will look much better with the higher resolution. I just wanted to gibe you an idea. If you'd like more examples of my work let me known I'm happy to offer them. Please send my a headshot or fully clothed picture that shows your face with your response and a good time to meet up for coffee and to talk about the photoshoot.

My name is Alexa and I have been longing to have my hair in dreadlocks for around 6 years now. After countless attempts of trying to teach myself and friends how to make dreads I have decided to extend my search to the internet.       I have looked into some local hair stylists but all have given me a price range of $700-$900 and I simply do not have that kind of money to spend on putting my hair in knots. I have bought myself extensions and have attempted many many times to make them into locks but my doubt has gotten the best of me and I don't believe they are up to my standards.       I have attached pictures of what I'm looking for. It would be a mix of dreads and small braids about 48 pieces total. I also have extensions that need to be dreaded as well. I have bangs that I plan on keeping.        I am willing to pay as close to $200 as possible as well as promise to give you a comfortable relaxing environment for the process. Please contact me if this is something that interests you or please pass it on to someone who may find interest. Thank you so much.    ,0,0.0,0
