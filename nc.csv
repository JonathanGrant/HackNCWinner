Sorry if I come across harshly but haven't had the best experiences through big shops. I am having issues with my power steering. The steering wheel is extremely difficult to turn. Power steering fluid was added about a week ago. Unfortunately I don't know how to check it myself. So I would like someone to come check it for me. I've bought some power steering with stop leak. I was told my a mechanic that this may help. He's also told me that there is a leak on one of the seals in my rack and pinion. I don't have the $900 quoted price to fix it! Can anyone please help me??? It's an old car. 2000 Buick Regal but only has about 135000 miles. If you can please help me I would be so grateful. If it turns out the rack and pinion has to be replaced looking for someone who can do a great job at a lower price. Thanks. Hoping to find someone close to uptown or Plaza Midwood area.       Amy

That's where you come in. So if you're wanting to be the next Ben Affleck & Matt Damon here's your chance. And I will be either one so you basically have your pick of being Ben or Matt. DAMN! Now that I have your attention got you hooked? Now you're eager... Here's what I've got so far if you think this is something that matches your style and you can vibe with it.....uhhhhh..let's just get to it am I right ???      Working Title: The Luckiest Wheelchair      Quick Rundown: A family leaves behind a really awesome dog at a family campground (kinda like Home Alone but with a dog) (and not at Christmas)...(YET)   This amazing well trained family dog is all alone wandering through the family campground and HOLY SHIT. He runs into a cute crippled kid in a DOPE AZZ wheely ride and guess who becomes instant BFFs..Imagine all the wacky and zany hair brained stunts these two will get into trying to get back home to...idk yet. I do know the wheels kid will have a NORTH FACE backpack and YES I know it has to be either red or blue. (duhh)... I am kinda thinking somehow the boys get to meet a string of super star celebrities on their journey. Who is going to say no to this??? We could also hashtag some people like Ellen and Shia LeBouf.       That's about all I have right now but as you can see for anyone average it's more than enough. I just want to kick it up a notch and make something real. If you think you have what it takes and can hang with this here is your invitation to greatness...........................................................thx

Ladies, want to be a photo model but told you have too many tattoos?,hickory,http://hickory.craigslist.org/crg/5852282928.html,2016-10-29T15:35:00-0400,34.925208,-81.026917,creative,Unknown,I am a hobbyist photographer (I do some paid stuff but mainly for fun) seeking a female model for some more metallic body-painting photos like the first several photos here (the rest of the photos are some of my other work.)      Ladies if you've wanted to be a model but have been told that you have too many tattoos this would be a great way to do some modeling (as the paint will cover any tattoos that you have.) The "paint" is a fine metallic powder (like used in makeup) that is mixed with hand sanitizer and then simply spread on and allowed to dry. So it can be cleaned off very easily with just soap & water.      This is a non-paid gig but you will get high-quality copies of all photos done so if you're working on building a portfolio this would be a great opportunity.

Small grading job,hickory,http://hickory.craigslist.org/lbg/5823472298.html,2016-10-11T11:50:11-0400,35.886251,-80.764575,labor,TBD,I need someone with a small skid steer to grade an area about 24'x24' to prep for a concrete slab for a carport/garage mostly just removing the grass as it will be filled with gravel. It's a small job as the land is relatively level as is my guess is it's about 6" or so high in about 1/4 of the area. Need someone that can do this as inexpensively as possible as I'm on a fixed income and it's only a few hours of work at most however I may need you again to spread the gravel once it's graded out. Please give me a call to set up a time to check out the job in person. Denis    show contact info
