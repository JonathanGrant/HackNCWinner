On another note... I had someone run the lines through the wall (behind the drywall) which evidently after reading the manual this is not the way this is done.  the only way I think these copper lines can be salvaged is if they are fitted with some angled connectors and flanged etc.  If you have this knowledge and tools that could work if not I was going to have to order another set of copper lines and run them the correct way and just forever seal these other lines up in the walls...    thanks!

Ladies, want to be a photo model but told you have too many tattoos?,columbia,http://columbia.craigslist.org/crg/5852284960.html,2016-10-29T15:36:15-0400,34.924786,-81.026402,creative,Unknown,I am a hobbyist photographer (I do some paid stuff but mainly for fun) seeking a female model for some more metallic body-painting photos like the first several photos here (the rest of the photos are some of my other work.)      Ladies if you've wanted to be a model but have been told that you have too many tattoos this would be a great way to do some modeling (as the paint will cover any tattoos that you have.) The "paint" is a fine metallic powder (like used in makeup) that is mixed with hand sanitizer and then simply spread on and allowed to dry. So it can be cleaned off very easily with just water.      This is a non-paid gig but you will get high-quality copies of all photos done so if you're working on building a portfolio this would be a great opportunity.

Ebay seller wanted,charlottesville,http://charlottesville.craigslist.org/dmg/5833985877.html,2016-10-18T02:31:06-0400,38.439121,-77.997590,domestic,20 pct,I am looking for someone with an established ebay account and good reputation with lots of sales.  I have approximately $10k worth of stuff I want to sell.  Lots of collectable games old stuff like Nintendo intellivision Commodore Amiga.  Also lots of football jerseys things I brought back from Africa Pakistan Afghanistan......and tools.  Tons of tools. Oh and around $2-3k in automotive body trip pieces. Big things that I have big boxes for.  Running boards bug guards bike racks.  All new.  These things are in my home in Culpeper VA.  I would like for someone to stay in a guest room enjoy the entire house and work from there if you have the flexibility to relocate temporarily.  If you would rather drive back and forth we can talk about it.  But I don't want this to drag on for a year so my first choice would be someone to bring some clothes and share the house with me.  You will be very safe.  I am offering 20% of what's left after ebay and paypal take their money.  For the auto parts and trim I will raise that to 30% because I didn't pay for those it was a condition of getting a part for my truck that I take it all as the guy was selling his house and needed it cleared.  So I just kind of fell into thousands of dollars in car parts.  If we do this right you could clear a couple thousand. But I want someone serious and who is very familiar with the ebay (or any online auction/sales process)

Construction Helper needed- Some exp.- Athletic Non-Smoker -$12 Hourly,lynchburg,http://lynchburg.craigslist.org/lbg/5805426200.html,2016-09-29T17:25:34-0400,37.382500,-79.218100,labor,$12 hourly,Helper needed - Some experience is required- Much experience would be better but not required - Athletic Non-Smoker -$12 Hourly -    Hi my name is Joe Pantana. I am a Handyman and do different construction type jobs for customers in and around Lynchburg. I need a helper to help me do odd jobs.      I will pay cash or check at the END of the work week or Daily.      Hours range from: 9am-7pm       I am an OK guy to work with. We will take small breaks as needed during our work.       *********************************************************************************************   Copy and paste the following into your CRAIGSLIST REPLY and then answer these questions COMPLETELY:      What is your motivation for working:   What interests you:   Full name:   Link to your Facebook page: (This is how I will check you out. Don't expect me to hire a total stranger for a job without seeing this information first.)   Where you live:   Your age:   Confirm that you do not smoke:   Confirm you are athletic:   Your phone number:   2 references with phone numbers:   Any Job Experience:   Race:   Male or Female:   Construction Skills:   Education:   Three things I am good at:   Three things I need to improve:   ******************************************************************************************      A personal note from Joe Pantana:    Consider the following as me being blunt and a way to separate the boys from the men. Don't take it personally but take it seriously.    I personally despise liars thieves and violence but if anyone threatens me my family or my livelihood there will be hell to pay. But if you are a genuinely honest and decent hardworking person I will be fair to you and help you if I can. If you are a good reliable helper you WILL receive a PAY raise on future jobs.       I am big on respect and fairness and will give credit where credit is due. I am not a talker unless there is something worth discussing. However I am not a discouraging person and will always give my best advice if I can.    I like to stay focused on work and keep a light and positive demeanor even when things get annoying and stressful. It is very important to always be respectful to me and to the customer. It is better to be respectful quiet careful patient and agreeable at a job. Customers are letting us into their homes and personal lives and are entrusting us with their safety and hard-earned money. They need to know that we are trustworthy and professionals with families and problems just like them. No one is the same but everyone deserves respect honesty and fairness. If a customer has questions about the job they hired us for tell them to "Ask Joe Pantana sir or maam." If you find us work you can be in charge but on my jobs its my paycheck my rules and I interact with the customer. Your just there to help me and get paid but will gladly except your knowledge and input that you have to offer as we work through problems on the job.      Understand that I do not trust you. You must earn my trust over time but I will treat you like a man. Also I am just a regular guy who is honest and hardworking. I don't like arrogant "Know it alls". No one knows everything and there are 10 different ways to do anything and they all work fine. Also everyone makes mistakes. That is how we learn. But we have to be careful not to make those mistakes all the same. Better to ask for help or double check your thought process than to make emotional or tired decisions and waste peoples time and money. I do like teamwork however. Getting the job done smoothly patiently without making consistent mistakes is my goal. I want to establish a work flow and run with it. I want to work hard and smart do a good job get paid a fair wage and go home to my family so I can get up the next morning and work some more.       I always attempt to follow the IRC the International Residential Building Code when completing a job.

My brother is dealing with a wife going through some severe postpartum and has been for quite a while. Her family is clueless because they live so far away.  What I'm looking for and will pay $350 for this onetime encounter is someone bumping into her out of the blue and letting her know her daughter is also at fault for their marriage suffering. They are a great couple and family and I'm hoping with a touch from someone outside the family may make a change and I'm willing to pay for this for my brother.  None of us are from the area so it would have to be an out of the blue encounter. Her mother is religious and I am hoping that something like this would help her see that maybe her daughter needs to talk to someone and that her marriage is worth saving. If I didn't believe this myself I wouldn't be doing any of this for my brother.       So if you are interested in this task and can pull something off that would require seeking her outside of her home and letting her know her daughter is making a mistake then let me know.

Ladies, want to be a photo model but told you have too many tattoos?,swva,http://hickory.craigslist.org/crg/5852282928.html,2016-10-29T15:35:00-0400,34.925208,-81.026917,creative,Unknown,I am a hobbyist photographer (I do some paid stuff but mainly for fun) seeking a female model for some more metallic body-painting photos like the first several photos here (the rest of the photos are some of my other work.)      Ladies if you've wanted to be a model but have been told that you have too many tattoos this would be a great way to do some modeling (as the paint will cover any tattoos that you have.) The "paint" is a fine metallic powder (like used in makeup) that is mixed with hand sanitizer and then simply spread on and allowed to dry. So it can be cleaned off very easily with just soap & water.      This is a non-paid gig but you will get high-quality copies of all photos done so if you're working on building a portfolio this would be a great opportunity.      You can see more of my work at the following websites:      https://www.facebook.com/Shutterbug-Photography-in-Rock-Hill-SC-173399406029015   https://www.flickr.com/photos/shutterbug-photo   http://www.shutterbug-photo.us/   https://www.facebook.com/Shutterbug.Photography.Rock.Hill.SC (personal facebook)

I was raised in Bethesda Maryland and own a Service Company that services many famous and wealthy people's homes there.       Many of my clients are Professional Atheltes  Television Personalities Doctors Lawyers and Corporate Presidents.        My association with them extends past our primary work association and also includes memberships to upscale clubs and civic organizations based in Bethesda Maryland.        We are also involved in many charitable endeavors.       I know them all very well.      A few years ago I was asked by a some of them as to whether I knew any attractive young girls that could attend a party at a famous person's home.      Of course my response was in the negative given I do not travel or associate in social circles that include girls half my age.      To my surprise the day after I mentioned it in passing to my step daughter she informed me that several of her friends were interested.       They attended the gathering and they had a great time.       Since then the list of those interested in meeting "attractive girls in their 20s" has grown to 37.        Some of the girls that originally provided friendly interactions with my clients have moved away or otherwise opted out for various reasons.       So we're in search of 10 new girls to accompany wealthy attractive and powerful men to events and in some instances (if you agree) to entertain them in more private settings where they are not likely to be recognized.       We are particular about who we chose and only need 7 more girls so do not miss out on this opportunity to meet men that could change your life for the positive.      My clients are all very generous and respectful and prefer the company of "wholesome girls" that are "outgoing and confident" as opposed to girls easily conquered.      They cannot seek companionship through online sources because they do not want connections to themselves through electronic communications or financial transactions.       They require separation and a high level of privacy which is why I've been asked to act on their behalf.       I've been asked to screen your pics and if I think you have the appearance and demeanor that my clients prefer I will request an interview.       If you think you could be described as "Outgoing Sexy and Confident please submit a few pictures and give a contact number.

Current Progress:  Lost ~30 lbs through diet and occasional exercise in 3 months.       Goal:     Lose at least 170 lbs and transform physically into the powerful alpha male I see myself as.       Aite.    So as a kid in MS and HS i was a force.  Big strong.    Wrestled played offense AND defense on the football field slammed homers in baseball....  etc.      Went to college discovered the joys of weed and booze and dropped out after 2 years.  (No longer use either...  though I smoke a pack and a half a day....)        Became a truck driver at 21....      9 years later of sitting on my ass driving all day living off truck stop/fast food...  Ive gained like 200 lbs since my hayday.   Heyday?   W/e.          Anyway...    I've gotten over the depression and sadness of being a failure (College drop out) and then becoming a lonely fatass in a truckstop parking lot.   Now im just an annoyed fatass looking for an assist in getting my shit together so I can start banging chicks a few points higher than my usual and making sure I dont have a heart attack or get diabetus.     Priorities.         Alright.  SO typically fat ppl are only concerned with losing weight but honestly....   Ive always been a 'big' guy.    And I enjoy the intimidation factor.

I've been doing it for a couple of months now and I absolutely love it. I started looking into it because I am doing online classes and wanted something I could do that would fit around my schedule. If you are interested in this please feel free to email me! I when you think of camming you think of dirty old men being just gross to you but it's not really that way. Don't get me wrong you will get those people from time to time but for the most part my customers are really respectful and they actually protect me for the rude or just nasty people. As far as money goes it just depends on how much time you put into. You have to treat it like your own business. I work about 6 hours a day on the cam and depending on the day I make around $100 - $150. I went through a studio called Boleyn Models and what they do is they allow you to sign up for a lot of the big camming sites and instead of you having to wait 2 weeks for a check Boleyn Models will pay you ever day. If this interest you feel free to check out the link below or email if you have any questions :) I promise I don't bite haha Also you can check me out on Twitter @PinupAlice just so you can see I'm real :)      https://boleynmodels.com/ref/535

Experienced Vocalist & Violinist Needed,jackson,http://jackson.craigslist.org/tlg/5823832172.html,2016-10-11T14:03:25-0500,32.266396,-90.124369,talent,Payment pending sale of completed track, exact compensation negotiable.,Looking for an experienced singer who might be interested in doing some recording. I would prefer a female vocalist as my music is geared more for a delicate voice I feel. But I would not discount a male singer particularly in a few of the pieces as those works have more of a masculine feel to them. Audition required. Payment pending sale of the track(s). Here is a small sample of my work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvNg9yx7iO4      Anyway I am also looking for a DJ and violinist particularly but not exclusively who are interested in working with a very creative experienced guitarist and songwriter to write with and record tracks. I have been playing almost 30 years from Bach to Slayer and everything in between. I have formally studied classical and rock guitar and I have been in rock bands metal bands and guitar ensembles since before I could drive. I studied classical under Dr. John Ingwerson of Hinds CC for two years and heavy metal foundations under Dr. Benjamin (Benjie) Makamson who himself studied under Marty Friedman of Megadeth and Jason Becker formerly of David Lee Roth's band.       I am a big fan of Ministry Tryad Enigma Ewan Dobson The Piano Guys Of Monsters and Men Faith No More Enya Lindsey Stirling The Cure Sia Fascinoma Kansas Pantera Queensryche Shinedown The Smashing Pumpkins and many others (just to give you an idea of my range of influences).       But I really like that combination where electronic meets instrumental and where everyone involved gets to add their own creative flavor to the music. And I think with the right musical artists we could create something this world has never seen. I am totally serious. My playing style is unlike anything else I have heard. I'm not bragging at all. It's unique not because it's crazy weird or even crazy good but because it's all over the place and it encompasses nearly all music genres. It has always irked me when someone asks me what kind of music I play. I usually just answer "I play...music" because I don't like being categorized like that mainly because it isn't usually applicable and I'm not so certain the stuff I write *can* be categorized.        I once read that if you practice something 10000 hours you've mastered it. I did the math and I am well beyond two years....total hours playing guitar. That's 17520 some-odd hours. I won't say I'm a master but I know I have spent more than two full years of my life playing a guitar. Thinking about it now that's insane! I *do* offer guitar lessons if anyone is interested btw. There is another post in the "Tutoring and Lessons" section for that.  :)      I have recording software and all the requisite equipment - microphones (dynamic and condenser) recording software and three studio areas. One of course is my living room which is being converted into a full-on studio. Location and sound quality isn't really a problem. Of course I am looking for anyone with real talent who is serious about recording...and a big plus if they have equipment of their own. I can and do perform gigs but I'm a full-time dad and scheduling them might be problematic. But I'm less interested in playing live than I am in producing some magic and putting it out there on YouTube ASCAP Soundcloud etc. I am tired of tinkering around at home. I want to get *paid* for the thousands of hours of practice songwriting and refining....and agonizing all these years.

I have stuff stored at 2 different storage places.  One near I55 in Jackson and the other on Lakeland in Flowood.  These 2 storage places are full of furniture equipment tables and other things I had in a large house from my marriage.       I am going to sell all of this stuff to you and your help for a $ 200 or so.  In other words your "payment" will be getting most of my stuff in storage ( furniture other stuff) for a very cheap price.  In return you need to haul it off and help me completely clean out one of my places.          Examples are a mahogany king size bed with side table leather chair couch persian rug and other things.  I'm going to sell this stuff at very very cheap prices ( to get rid of so I don't have to store it anymore) ...maybe a few hundred dollars.  I'm clearing everything out of the larger storage and half of the stuff out of the smaller storage.        You can keep everything for a fire sale price ( I really just want to get rid of )  Anything you don't want I do ask you to haul away.  I will keep a few things that will fill about half of the small place. (as I said we're cleaning out the larger place and I'm closing that one )        If you'd like to look at everything first that's fine.  It's probably a few thousand dollars worth of stuff I'll be letting go for much much less.   I just need someone to haul it away from both of my places.  At least a two man job as I can't do any work due to back issues.   Looking to do preferably this Saturday sometime.   Let me know.  Thanks.

Make 6 Figures Online,nashville,http://nashville.craigslist.org/cpg/5851524487.html,2016-10-29T04:01:15-0500,36.118500,-86.263000,computer,Depends on your level,Everybody is looking to make some extra money. Whether you are looking to make money to pay off debt to pay for school just to have more income or to quit work there is a desire in everyone's heart to make more money.           But how? If you already work 40 hours a week it's hard to bring yourself to get a second full time job. Not only that but most of the time the work schedules wouldn't work together allowing you to spend time with your family and get rest for the next work day.           So you have come up with the idea of making money online. Sketchy? It can be. You really have to watch out for online scammers that only want your money and don't give any sense of direction on how to make online income. I have fallen for these types of scams too. That is not what this is.           Digital Altitude is a program built by Michael Force. It is a proven system to make money online. It's really simple and all it takes to start is $1. Really all you have to do is walk around the block and find 4 quarters and you will have your foot in the door.           The only thing I ask of you is to be persistent. Don't give up. Don't get discouraged. I'll let you know now that before you can start making money you have to watch 18 videos about what this program does how it makes money and how it can help you. Most people won't tell you about this they just ask you to join up. 18 videos sounds like a lot but it's really not. The first 6 videos are between 30 minutes and an hour. The last 12 videos range from 4 minutes to 30 minutes. A very neat feature about Digital Altitude is that you have a coach that you will personally talk to through Skype email and/or on the phone. How many other programs do you know hat has their own personal coach appointed for you?           If you decide to turn back there is a 14 day period in which you can get your dollar back. You should however know whether you want to turn back within the first few days because it takes 2-3 days for your $1 back to process.           If you believe you are ready to put your foot through the door create a new mindset make money provide for your family and have as much time freedom as you wish this program is for you.

On another note... I had someone run the lines through the wall (behind the drywall) which evidently after reading the manual this is not the way this is done.  the only way I think these copper lines can be salvaged is if they are fitted with some angled connectors and flanged etc.  If you have this knowledge and tools that could work if not I was going to have to order another set of copper lines and run them the correct way and just forever seal these other lines up in the walls...    thanks!
