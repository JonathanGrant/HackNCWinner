Foragr is a website that makes finding part-time jobs/gigs easier for #vanlifers and others who move around a lot.
We scrape craigslist for data on part-time gigs and display them on an interactive topographic map layer using ESRI's ArcGIS platform. We also created a native iOS app to accompany the desktop site.

This website was created in less than 24 hours at HackNC.
